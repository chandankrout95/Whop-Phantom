/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a dual-access security model. A privileged 'admin' role has full control over shared, application-wide data like SMM panel configurations. Regular users operate in a strictly sandboxed environment, with access confined to their own user profile and order history.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /smm_panels/{panelId}: A top-level collection containing SMM panel configurations, services, and categories. This data is considered public-readable for all signed-in users but writable only by admins.
 * - /users/{userId}: A top-level collection storing individual user profiles and their private subcollections (e.g., orders). Access is restricted based on the user's UID.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A special collection that serves as an access control list. The existence of a user's UID as a document ID in this collection grants them admin privileges across the application.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role Management: Admin status is determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin` collection. To maintain security, only existing admins can grant or revoke admin privileges for other users.
 * - User Data Isolation: All user-specific data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring strict data privacy through path-based security rules. Users cannot see or interact with other users' data.
 * - User Enumeration Prevention: Listing documents in the top-level `/users` and `/roles_admin` collections is explicitly forbidden to prevent malicious actors from discovering all users or admins.
 * - Read vs. Write Access: A clear distinction is made between public-readable data (the SMM service catalog) and protected write operations. All signed-in users can browse services, but only admins can modify them. All user data is private for both reads and writes.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - To ensure path integrity, subcollection documents like Orders must contain a `userId` field that matches the `{userId}` in the path. This is validated on creation to link the data to its owner permanently.
 * - Similarly, `categories` and `services` under a specific SMM panel must contain a matching `smmPanelId` to prevent data from being created in the wrong context. This is enforced on creation and made immutable on update.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - The ruleset leverages separate top-level collections for shared data (`smm_panels`) and private user data (`users`). This segregation provides a clear security boundary and enables efficient, secure list operations for browsing services without exposing any private information.
